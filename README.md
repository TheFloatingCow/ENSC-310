ENSC 310

Contains all my projects from SFU ENSC 310. 

Project list:
  - Search Assignment
      - Create a grid world, with walls and dirty floors. An agent (cleaning robot) must use different grid search algorithms to find paths to the next dirty patch.
  - TicTacToe Assignment
      - Built an AI that uses search algorithms to play TicTacToe. While TicTacToe is a solved game, this program is not constrained by board size will play on larger boards.
  - Reinforcement Learning Project
      - Used various reinforcement learning algorithms to navigate a grid world, where the agent can gain or lose points.
  - Classification Assignment
      - Built a perceptron to read handwriting with high accuracy.
